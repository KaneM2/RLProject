### Reinforcement Learning 

**Snake**

To see the results of Neural Network function approximation applied to Snake
1. Run DQN.py  (This trains the neural network and may take many hours to run)
2. Optional: Observe reward per episode on Tensorboard
3. Stop DQN.py or wait for it to finish training
4. Run DQNobserve.py to observe the learned strategy

* humanPlay.py contains code that was used to test functionality of Snake
* DQN.py contains code for training Deep Q Network on Snake Game
* DQNobserve.py contains code for observing the learned policy
* gridSnake.py contains code for the mechanics of the game
