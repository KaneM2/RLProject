### Reinforcement Learning 

**Snake**

To see the results of Neural Network function approximation applied to Snake
1. Run DQN.py  (This trains the neural network and may take many hours to run)
2. Optional: Observe reward per episode on Tensorboard
3. Stop DQN.py or wait for it to finish training
4. Run DQNobserve.py to observe the learned strategy
